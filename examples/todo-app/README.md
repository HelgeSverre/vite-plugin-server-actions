# TODO App example using Vite Server Actions

This is an example of a simple TODO app using Vite Server Actions and Svelte.

It demonstrates how to use Vite Server Actions to create a simple TODO app where the user can add, remove, and mark
tasks as completed, where all CRUD actions are handled by the server action and stored in a json file, this allows us to
use node features like accessing the file system and storing data in a file without having to setup a separate server or
API.

## Running the example

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
